- Shows percentage of total budget allocated
- Helps you see if funds are being distributed

#### Spent Funds  
- Actual money that has been spent on projects

- Tracks real spending progress

#### Remaining Funds
- Money that's allocated but not yet spent
- Available for ongoing project expenses

### 2. **Budget Allocation Progress**
Visual bar showing:
- **Green Bar**: How much of the total budget has been allocated to projects

## 📊 Understanding Project Information

### Each Project Shows:

1. **Project Name & Category**
   - Clear identification with category badge
   - Example: "Community Park Development" - Environment

2. **Status Badge**
   - **Active** (Green): Project is ongoing
   - **Completed** (Blue): Project finished
   - **Paused** (Yellow): Temporarily on hold

3. **Financial Breakdown**
   - **Allocated**: Funds assigned to this project
   - **Spent**: Money used so far
   - **Available**: Can still be spent
   - **Budget**: Total project budget

4. **Progress Bars**
   - Visual representation of spending
   - Easy to understand at a glance

5. **Project Manager**
   - Wallet address of responsible official
   - Enables accountability

6. **Blockchain Verification**
   - 🔗 Link to verify transaction on blockchain
   - Proof that data hasn't been tampered with

## 🔐 Why Blockchain Matters

### Immutability
Once recorded on blockchain, data cannot be changed or deleted. This means:
- No one can hide spending
- Historical records are permanent
- Full audit trail always available

### Transparency
Every transaction is public and verifiable:
- Click any blockchain link to see proof
- Verify on Mumbai PolygonScan
- Check timestamps and transaction details

### Accountability
Every action is tracked:
- Who created the project
- Who allocated funds
- Who approved expenditures
- When everything happened

## 📱 How to Monitor Projects

### Step 1: View Dashboard
Visit the main page to see:
- Overall fund allocation
- Total spending
- Active projects

### Step 2: Click on Any Project
Get detailed information:
- All project milestones
- Complete expenditure history
- Progress over time

### Step 3: Check Milestones
See project phases:
- What needs to be accomplished
- Target budget for each phase
- Current spending on each milestone
- Completion status

### Step 4: Review Expenditures
Every expense is categorized:
- **Materials**: Building supplies, equipment
- **Labor**: Worker payments
- **Equipment**: Machinery, tools
- **Services**: Professional services
- **Permits**: Licenses and approvals
- **General**: Other necessary expenses

For each expenditure, see:
- Amount spent
- Category
- Description
- Recipient address
- Blockchain proof

## 🎯 Key Metrics to Watch

### 1. Allocation Rate
**What it means**: Percentage of budget assigned to projects
- **High (80%+)**: Funds actively being used
- **Low (<50%)**: Money sitting unused

### 2. Spending Rate
**What it means**: Percentage of allocated funds actually spent
- **Steady progress**: Good project execution
- **Very slow**: Possible delays or issues
- **Too fast**: Need to verify proper use

### 3. Budget Utilization
**What it means**: Overall percentage of total budget spent
- Shows efficiency of fund use
- Helps compare against previous periods

### 4. Milestone Completion
**What it means**: Number of completed project phases
- Indicates real progress
- Shows project advancement

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: How often is data updated?
**A**: Real-time! Every transaction is recorded immediately on the blockchain.

### Q: Can I trust this data?
**A**: Yes! Click any blockchain link to independently verify on PolygonScan. The data is immutable and cannot be altered.

### Q: What if I see something suspicious?
**A**: 
1. Note the project name and transaction hash
2. Verify on blockchain explorer
3. Contact municipal authorities with specifics
4. All evidence is permanently recorded

### Q: Why are some funds "allocated" but not "spent"?
**A**: This is normal. Funds are allocated to projects first, then spent over time as work progresses. It's like budgeting - you set aside money before you spend it.

### Q: What's the difference between Budget and Allocated?
**A**: 
- **Budget**: Total money available from municipality
- **Allocated**: Money assigned to specific projects
- **Spent**: Money actually used
- **Remaining**: Allocated minus Spent

### Q: Can anyone create a project?
**A**: No. Only authorized project managers (with connected wallets) can create projects and record expenditures. But everyone can VIEW all projects.

### Q: What is a wallet address?
**A**: It's like a digital ID for the project manager. Example: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb

### Q: Is this on "real" blockchain?
**A**: Yes! We use Polygon Mumbai testnet, which functions exactly like a real blockchain but uses test tokens (no real money required for citizens viewing data).

## 🔗 Verify Everything

### How to Verify a Transaction:

1. **Find the Transaction**
   - Click the 🔗 icon next to any project or expenditure

2. **Opens PolygonScan**
   - Shows blockchain explorer
   - Independent verification

3. **Check Details**
   - Transaction hash (unique ID)
   - Timestamp (when it happened)
   - Block number (where it's stored)
   - Status (confirmed/pending)

4. **Trust the Source**
   - PolygonScan is independent
   - Data comes directly from blockchain
   - Cannot be manipulated

## 📈 Track Progress Over Time

### Use Transaction History:
1. Go to "Transactions" page
2. Filter by type:
   - Project Creation
